# What is HTML

Essentially a collection of tags

##

`<tag-name />`

##

`<tag-name> content </tag-name>`

##

`<tag-name attribute="value" />`

<aside class="notes">
  Show some examples of websites, and show that they are all just HTML
</aside>

# Static vs dynamic website?

What is the difference?

# all will be OK!

<aside class="notes">
  - Now code something :)
  - Show dumbest possible website,
  - even missing `<html>`-tag etc. Still works
</aside>

# Common tags

## HTML

`<html> ... </html>`

## BODY

`<body> ... what peopel see! .. </body>`

## Tags for text

- `<h1>`
- `<h2>`
- `<h3>`
- `<p>`

## Useful tags

- `<a href="...">Click me</a>`
- `<img src="..." />`
- `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`

<aside class="notes">
Ahoy there! Why doesn't img have a closing tag? __Explain!__
</aside>

## The _Division element_

- `<div>`

<aside class="notes">
  - Spend some time explaining div's?
  - kind of the most abstract tag, since you cannot really see it
</aside>

# Let's try it!

<aside class="notes">
- give them 10 minutes or so to get a basic page up
- leave this open while they try to make a website themselves
</aside>

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`
- `<h1>`
- `<p>`
- `<a href="...">`
- `<img src="..." />`

# Get some style

CSS aka Cascading Style Sheet

<aside class="notes">
  - Explain that HTML is for content. CSS is for styling
  - Separation of content and its presentation
</aside>

# How to use styles

Styles can be applied to tags

<aside class="notes">
  Show how you can style tags
</aside>

# Selective styling

- Identifying individual tags with `id`
- Identifying groups of tags by `class`

<aside class="notes">
  - really make sure they understand classes and id's
  - these will be good to know once they start with javascript
  - show examples
</aside>

# Sharing your style

<aside class="notes">
  - instead of defining `style`-tags everywhere, use a .css file
  - share styles between multiple pages
  - this is better done by example
</aside>

# Index

The first page is called the `index`

<aside class="notes">
  - explain that it is good to have an index.html file
</aside>

# Challenge!

- Create a page about you (index.html)
- Describe yourself, and your background
- Create pages for your hobbies
- Link to hobby pages from index page

# Demo!
